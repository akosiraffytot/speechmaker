# Assets Directory

This directory contains application assets such as icons and images.

## Required Files

- `icon.ico` - Windows icon file for the application (256x256 recommended)
- `icon.png` - PNG version of the application icon (256x256 recommended)

## Notes

The actual icon files should be added before building the application for distribution.
For development purposes, the application will work without these files, but may show default Electron icons.
